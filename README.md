# ITS-250-PROJECT1-TylerPatrick-Cameron-Andrews
For our project we will be making a program of well you are exercising.
The user will be prompted with hours many hours they have worked out that day.
Depending on their answer, the program will inform them that they have worked out too little, too much, the right amount, or that they haven;t worked out at all.
